# Denison Laundry Status API

## Dev Note:

~~project is under maintenance, please try again when this line is removed. I am kinda busy with college lately xD~~
It turns out the API host expires my auth token. All I need to do is setup the interceptor to extract the auth token and update project secrets. Now it should work normally.

## Siri Shortcut

- Link to the Siri shortcut that calls this API:
- https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/44d1ee9e73de4da4b275ca87ba9558f2
- This will allow you to ask Siri to speak the "messages" key of the response body whenever you say "laundry status"
- You can customize the summon command (default by "laundry status") to whatever you like by editing the shortcut yourself.
- You can edit the hall you want to know the status of (usually the hall you are living in). By default it's Curtis Hall because I live there üòÅ
